The self checking math Spinner
I was looking for something educational to 3d print for my child in Thingiverse and came across the concept of the math Spinner. I found the models lacked a method of checking the answer so I wanted to automate it. The core design is inspired from the ‘Math Spinner’ by FunFunBoy (https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:1604600) and the ‘Math Spinner Enhanced’ by Pauloblank (https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:452651).

The Math scroller at its core uses eight absolute encoders, a handful of 8-Bit I/O Expanders and an arduino nano to read the values and check the answer function. A piezo provides some basic sounds and some RGB Leds are used to finish off the effects for a correct and incorrect answer.

From start of concept design to completed unit the project took several months after work. With many design iterations, excessive part purchases and prototype failures along the way. In the end the following tools would be required to repeat this project:
3d Cad Software
Electronic Circuit design software
Soldering Iron,
3d printer - dual printer with a 300x300 bed size (0.2 was used for layer heights and some supports were used on some parts.
Drill (drill bits for reaming holes and thread taps to help seat screws)
Wire stripper and crimping tools
Pocket voltmeter
A large Bread Board
